        <h4>Test Case 2 - Completing the checkout process</h4>  
        <p>The test logs into an e-commerce site as a registered user, purchases an item of clothing and goes through checkout. It then captures the order number displayed on the ‘Order received’ page and checks that it is also present in the ‘My Orders’ section of the site.</p>
